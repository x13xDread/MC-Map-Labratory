# MC-Map-Labratory
Contains World files, structure files, textures, sounds, custom mobs, custom items, and anything else I used to make this map.

## World Download
The world folder is the entire "Making Map" folder or there is a zip file which can be extracted into your world directory.

## World Version
The World can only be used on MC 1.17 as of now. In the future, future versions will be tested for compatibility

## Custom Mobs/Items
No Mods are used for this map, so all the custom mobs and items are created using commands. Make your own at https://mcstacker.net/
