# MC-Map-Labratory
Contains World files, structure files, textures, sounds, custom mobs, custom items, and anything else I used to make this map.

## World Download
The world folder is the entire "Making Map" folder or there is a zip file which can be extracted into your world directory.

## World Version
The World can only be used on MC 1.17 as of now. In the future, future versions will be tested for compatibility

## Custom Mobs/Items
No Mods are used for this map, so all the custom mobs and items are created using commands. Make your own at https://mcstacker.net/

## Pre-releases
The Pre-release branch holds future updates to the main map that can be tested by players as they are added, play these versions at your own risk as they may be incomplete or be drastically different from the current version. Keep in mind pre-release stuff is subject to change at anytime.
